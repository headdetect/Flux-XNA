Flux is a 2D game created first in XNA by headdetect. It's plan is to be ported to several other devices/languages.


##Objective
+ Your objective as the player is to get the ball to touch the goal. 
+ There are objects in your way blocking you. 
+ The only way you can move is by spinning your ball over/to 100 MPH and letting it fly. 
+ You can use items in your toolbox to help you get to the goal. 

##Controls
###PC
+ `Space` - Spin your ball
+ `Mouse Left-Click` - Action (Move blocks, click on stuff, etc..)
+ `R` - Restart
+ `Esc` - Access Pause Menu

###XBOX

##Development
###Theme making 
Currently the only way to make a new theme is by creating a new launcher and setting the theme directory (With compiled assets).
However, in the future, I will make it changeable through an interactive menu.

###Reqest a pull
I will requests pulls if they:
+ Are well documented.
+ Meet my coding style (Im picky about that)
+ Have been tested.

###Report a problem 
Just make a new issue. Try to give me information on how to recreate the issue.
